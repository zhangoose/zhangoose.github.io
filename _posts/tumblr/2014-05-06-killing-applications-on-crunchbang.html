<p>So I use the debian-based linux distro called Crunchbang (that apparently not a lot of people know about). I use it because my netbook can&#8217;t do jackshit but Crunchbang (no, not even the windows starter  pack).</p>
<p>The sad part is that after 1.5 whole years of using this distro and after 2.5 whole years of using some sort of linux, I finally look up how to kill applications (like in Windows, we have task manager).</p>
<p>Turns out that if you hit Alt + F2, it&#8217;ll bring up the Run prompt &lt;&#8212; I actually didn&#8217;t know that. I knew about the Alt + F3 thing, but not Alt + F2. Then, there&#8217;s this thing called <strong>xkill</strong>. So if you type that in, you can kill any application you want! It&#8217;s actually really friendly and easy to use. You just &#8230; click on the window whose application you want to kill. So simple. Why didn&#8217;t I know it before? </p>
<p>Since my explanation sucks, <a href="http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=13589%23p13589">here&#8217;s the person I got this solution from! </a> </p>
<p>&#8230;..</p>
<p>After looking at the source he linked to in his post, I feel so dumb because I totally forgot about the &#8220;kill&#8221; command&#8230; smh.</p>
