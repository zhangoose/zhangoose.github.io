<p>So even though I really don&#8217;t like how Tumblr changed the way you post stuff (now it&#8217;s a drop-down kind of speech-bubble thing (wow, excuse the lack of terminology)), I decided to make my newly-purchased domain name to point to this Tumblr url (which I still don&#8217;t quite understand how that linking thing worked out, but it did, so, yeah), felt like a good place to start.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>Only problem was trying to figure out how to make this Tumblr page look like a personal webpage. Then I stumbled upon <a href="http://ialja.com/" title="ialja">iAlja&#8217;s</a> blog and was like<em> &#8220;oh hay, this could totes pass off as a tumblr and a personal webpage&#8221; </em>so, being inspired by what she did with her site, I decided to take up this first order of business of making my own Tumblr theme! &#8230; and tackling my fear of CSS. I say fear, but it&#8217;s mostly just frustrations upon frustrations.</p>
<p>Anyways, so I dove in and mostly used none other than <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes">Tumblr&#8217;s Creating a custom HTML theme post.</a></p>
<p>Well, it kind of took a REALLY long time to wrap my head around because it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve done anything layout/theme-y <em>(*cough* neopets *cough* gaiaonline *cough* therefore like 5-10 years ago)</em>. </p>
<p>For some reason, I always thought meta tags in HTML were mostly used for SEO stuff (for page descriptions and titless). But apparently, for Tumblr, meta tags are used to tell Tumblr &#8220;ok I want whatever is in this meta tag to be customizable&#8221; which is actually pretty neat, another usage for meta tags, yay. </p>
