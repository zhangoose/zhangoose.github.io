<a href="http://www.gitlab.com">GitLab.com | Open Source Git Management Software</a><br/><p>I am such a cheapo. If I can get something for free, I am not going to pay for the added on features (unless it&#8217;s Notability because that app is amazing, but that&#8217;s for another day).</p>
<p>So, I applied for a private repository through Github (because I have an edu email account and for some reason I fucked up while registering for a Github account so I didn&#8217;t get my private repository) a while ago, they didn&#8217;t get back to me, and now I&#8217;m at that point where I really need version control for my school project. Well, it&#8217;s a school project so I can&#8217;t make it a public repository. I&#8217;m also for some reason against using bitbucket (I have no idea why, probably because I associate it with mercurial even though it does have git functionality). </p>
<p>After lots of googling, I came across this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2378120/is-there-a-free-private-git-repository">SO question/answe</a>r. If you scroll down a bit, you&#8217;ll see some guy who posted a REALLY long response that kind of looks like a job listing that&#8217;s being all like &#8220;oh-yeah-we-need-this-and-this-and-this-and-this-and-&#8230;&#8230;-and-this-and-this-but-oh-right-i-forgot-to-mention-this-is-an-entry-level-position-so-we-don&#8217;t-pay-you-anything.&#8221; Though it sounded like a straight-up advertisement with like no discreetness at all about it being an advertisement, I decided to check out this Gitlab&#8212;mostly because the ad opened with something about it having free private repositories. </p>
<p>First thought: damn this looks just like Github. Second thought: just kidding, pretty much every project manager looks like Github. Maybe even bitbucket (which I have never actually used). </p>
<p><strong>Works like a charm</strong> (mostly since it also uses git (oh shit serious? because <em>git</em>lab totes didn&#8217;t give it away)), <strong>also links with your gmail/twitter/github</strong> (not too sure if I like that feature, as much as I hate creating new accounts, I hate linking a little more, unless I&#8217;m working on a webapp that needs user accounts, then linking is my lazy side&#8217;s biffle), and <strong>is totally private. </strong></p>

<p><strong>&#8230;&#8230;..tl;dr- gitlab is valid as a free private repo manager. yep.</strong></p>
