<p>So I was sitting in my Internet Technology class one day, super bored, decided that my handwriting deteriorated a little too much during winter break, and looked to my netbook for taking notes instead. I usually use vim and just do a <code>vim 0129</code> where the filename would just be whatever date it was that day. And that totally worked most of the time unless there were super complex diagrams involved.</p>
<p>But then I found this cool thing called <em>Markdown</em> (which I actually knew before through Github, but didn&#8217;t really pay attention to it until recently). More specifically, <em>Taking Notes With Markdown</em>. &#8230;.. And then after that, I discovered the art of <em>Making Blog Posts With A Markdown To HTML Translator</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start with why it&#8217;s really nice to take notes with Markdown. A little background: I never use Windows unless it&#8217;s on a school computer (or for work); I am, for many reasons, a Linux user. Therefore, I never really have Microsoft Office and its user-friendly-ish What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get editor around. Sure, I have Libre Office around, but trying to learn how to use 2 rich text editors that are pretty much the same in functionality but different in where certain properties are is actually really annoying.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s Markdown. I knew some of my friends in Computer Science take notes with Markdown (one of them does LaTeX, which is pretty awesome), but I never really got into it because I was like <em>"oh god, I don&#8217;t really feel like learning this syntax"</em> (which is actually really really simple). So anyway, long story short, yes, use Markdown to take notes if most of what you write is going to be straight-up English (and content). And maybe not a lot of diagrams. And here&#8217;s why:</p>
<h4>Why you should use Markdown to take notes?</h4>
<ul><li>Syntax is mad easy.</li>
<li>Way faster than dropping the drop-down bar for the headers.</li>
<li>I do what I want, red lines. If I say <code>malloc</code> is a word, then <code>malloc</code> is a word.
<ul><li>If I want to make the first letter in that line lowercased, no auto-capitalizing it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>More organized than plain .txt files (for you people who take notes in <code>vim 0129</code>.</li>
<li>HTML/PDF convertable.</li>
<li>Esp. for Computer Science students: you can make tags.
<ul><li>Teacher puts code block on board, you type it out in your non-markdown editor, it blends in with the rest of your text, if only it looked like actual code like:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><code>char * p = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char)*10));</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now that you know why I think you should use Markdown to take notes, I&#8217;m going to move on to the main point I&#8217;m trying to make here.</p>
<h4>Why you should use Markdown to make blog posts?</h4>
<ul><li>HTML tags are really annoying to type out.</li>
<li>More options, sometimes.</li>
</ul><p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">really good cheat-sheet for the Markdown syntax</a>. Believe me, that&#8217;s all you need to learn it (and either an editor with live previewing, which is always nice, or if you&#8217;re more of a vim/emacs/nano-for-everything user, an interpretter/converter for Markdown).</p>
<p>A couple notes: tables are apparently not supported in original Markdown syntax. There are a couple plug-ins you can use such as Multimarkdown (which, if I remember correctly, also incorporates <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>).</p>
<p><strong>For iOS users</strong>: You guys have a <em>lot</em> of options for text editors. Most of my frieds use <a href="http://mouapp.com/">Mou</a>. As you can see from the website, it comes with live previewing. But I&#8217;ve never used it.</p>
<p><strong>For Linux users</strong>: there&#8217;s <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/retext/">ReText</a> which is free and has live previewing and conversions to HTML/PDF/ODT. Only bad part is that it doesn&#8217;t support Multimarkdown (and I don&#8217;t think it can, but I&#8217;ll update this if I find a way). It&#8217;s pretty straight-forward and to-the-point. I would definitely recommend this for someone just starting or, well, anyone who does not feel a need for Multimarkdown. I&#8217;m actually using it right now to type up this blog post, and it&#8217;s perfect.</p>
