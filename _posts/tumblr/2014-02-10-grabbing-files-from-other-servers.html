<p><strong>tl;dr - scp is a pretty cool command for frequent ssh-ers.</strong></p>
<p>For those of you who have to <code>ssh</code> into your school directories, this is a pretty useful trick. Being a student at Rutgers, I find myself constantly ssh-ing into the ilab machines. So today moring, I had to finish up an assignment I started last night and submit it before 6:40pm today. So I ssh&#8217;ed, tmux/vim&#8217;d, and finished. Then I discovered a problem: <em>how am I going to submit this?</em> Those of you unfamiliar with Rutgers&#8217; Sakai submissions, we have to submit our files through a site called Sakai. There is no <em>"which server would you like to upload from"</em> kind of thing built into it (though, that would be really nice), so it can only upload from your own directory. I had my file on an ilab server.</p>
<p><span>Thanks to Google, found a command called </span><code>scp</code><span>. What </span><code>scp</code><span> does is take a file from an ssh-able server and spits it out in any local directory you want. After trying to figure out what the </span><code>man</code><span> page was saying, I found </span><a href="http://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php">this</a><span>Â which is basically the </span><code>man</code><span> page for dummies.</span></p>
<pre>scp USERNAME@SERVER:PATH_NAME_OF_FILE LOCAL_DIRECTORY</pre>
<p>Should, after entering in whatever credentials needed for that server/login, drop the file you want in your LOCAL_DIRECTORY. Super useful, now I can submit my assignment, woo.</p>
