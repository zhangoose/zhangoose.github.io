<p>My next thing I need to figure out is CSS. Like actually figure out. Not just trial-and-error&#8230; As I have been guiltily doing for the most part. </p>
<p>I will first start at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">w3schools </a>(since just about everyone does that), then it&#8217;ll probably just be moving things around on test sites&#8230; AKA more trial and error. I mean, that&#8217;s a way to learn, right? But I think the key there is that instead of trial-error-forget, it should be trial-error-learn, so hopefully when you trial-error again, you&#8217;ll remember what happened last time! You know, have a brain and stuff. Okay, guiltily, I have not done that.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>My general attitude towards CSS is &#8220;screw that&#8221;, &#8220;don&#8217;t feel like caring&#8221;, &#8220;ain&#8217;t nobody got time for that.&#8221; But I&#8217;m looking to change that! &#8230; or just improve upon my understanding of it so I&#8217;m not just splashing around chrome&#8217;s dev tools. </p>
<p>You know, there really should be some kind of CSS-generator where you just move blocks around a website to where you want them, and you get CSS corresponding to those moves. <a href="http://css3generator.com/">This sounds something like it&#8230; </a> But not quite. <a href="http://css3please.com/">This seems like a cuter version of the above, but it seems to yield the same results.</a></p>
<p>I imagine there&#8217;d be a <strong>lot</strong> of complications of my idea of a CSS-generator (like a full-fledged one) due to the relative positioning. </p>
<p>Anyways, back on topic. I&#8217;m tempted to read an actual book on CSS but I have a feeling CSS, like almost every programming language, is something you can only learn effectively by trying it out. So, for now, I will stick with w3. </p>
<p>This also ties in with my plan of bettering the layout of this Tumblr. Update on progress: I have decided to just take apart a really simple Tumblr layout and play with the CSS.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Just kidding, decided to make it from the bottom up instead of taking the shortcut. So here&#8217;s what my site looks like without the CSS. </p>
