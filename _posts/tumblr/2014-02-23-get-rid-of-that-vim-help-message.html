<pre>:nmap &lt;F1&gt; &lt;nop&gt; </pre>
<p>Finally FINALLY did the deed. Added that line to my vimrc. </p>
<p>For people who really hate accidentally hitting the F1 button their keyboards while in vim and having that really annoying help screen pop up, append that line to your vimrc and it&#8217;ll probably extend your life. Less stress, y&#8217;know. </p>
