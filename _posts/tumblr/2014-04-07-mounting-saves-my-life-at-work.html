<p>Well, if by life I mean productivity, yes. </p>
<p>So a little background information: I usually code using a combination of tmux and vim, to say the least. I work in the Rutgers SAS-IT office on College Ave, whose office is actually just a really small house. Over there, I make super small webapps to do super easy stuff like parse through log files and (what I&#8217;m working on right now), calculating the time between two dates accounting for workhours and holidays. To do that, I have to SSH into a server. However, that server is super basic and doesn&#8217;t have anything (and can&#8217;t have anything) I need to work (tmux and an editable vimrc). Well shit, there goes my productivity right?</p>
<p>I know that server file system and I guess the basic ZendFramework setup (well, at least the jail cell I&#8217;m limited to) super well now. Why? I kept cd ../../../&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;-ing EVERYWHERE all the time to get places, then I vim some file, then I forget what I was trying to add to that file, so I have to cd away from that file to vim the previous file I was at, only to cd back to the directory whose file I was going to edit. That was basically how I got things &#8220;done&#8221; for a good 2 months (oh god, the shame). </p>
<p>But then the other day, my coworker was observing me cd-ing about and mentioned that I should try to <strong>mount</strong> the server to a local directory. He explained that if you mount the server to a local directory, you can edit your server files from that local directory and it will be changed on the server, so less SSH-ing. </p>
<p>That. was. fucking. awesome. No, seriously, I was like &#8220;what the fuck, you can do that?!?!?!&#8221; So I proceeded to do that and OHMYGAWD I HAVE TMUX. I HAVE A COOL VIMRC. ]</p>
<p>So before this turns into a completely fruitless post, <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/how-to-mount-a-remote-folder-using-ssh-on-ubuntu/">here is the tutorial I used to mount my server.</a> This is actually the ubuntu way (since I&#8217;m running elementaryOS on my work computer), so it&#8217;s probably different for you guys. </p>
<p>But yeah, pretty awesome shit, definitely check it out if you&#8217;re as unfortunate as I to not know such a thing existed.</p>
<p>orz so hard right now.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr-</strong> mounting a server to your local directory is pretty awesome and <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/how-to-mount-a-remote-folder-using-ssh-on-ubuntu/">here&#8217;s how to do it.</a></p>
