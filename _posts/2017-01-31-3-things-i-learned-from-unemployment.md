title: "3 Things I Learned From Unemployment"

I was unemployed for around 2 months starting mid-November. It was a weird ride filled with support but confusion, as I assume most periods of unemployment are like. But, in the end, I think I came out with a much clearer vision of what I want and how I want to get there. I read a lot of "How To Be Unemployed" posts, mostly things from Reddit my friend sent me. They definitely helped! Aaand some made me feel like I was completely doomed if that's what some kid on the internet was doing. So I figured, why not share what I learned from these 2 months? I can only hope this will help someone realize some of these things faster than I did!

### Setting goals and timelining out the week are important

I feel like when most people talk about unemployment, they talk about how it's hard to keep their self worth in check. I mean, who wouldn't? After so many phone calls or skype screenings that don't work out, it's only a matter of time. For me, I found peace in working on side projects and making a *lot* of to-do lists. Being able to cross off individual tasks and mark (some) goals as completed for my project felt amazing and definitely helped keep my spirits up. I controlled my own self worth--not a company's decision.

More importantly, though as a side effect, I rediscovered why I enjoy coding. Yeah, that sounds corny, but I feel like it's not uncommon while working at a company to lose sight of or be a little unclear of that. Maybe because the projects weren't challenging enough, or maybe because whatever else comes with working with a team was distracting. For me at least, having the time and energy to work on something without limitations only made me feel more clarity in my otherwise unsettling situation. 

I guess, also as another side effect, when interviewers asked things like "so what have you been doing in the past 2 months?" I could be all like "no, I wasn't drinking every weekend or playing a lot of Left 4 Dead 2, I was working on blah blah and learning blah." 

### Happiness and mental health come first

This may come with positivity, but something I had to remind myself for a while was that I was still allowed to spend money. I was still allowed to keep renting out my studio, going out with my friends, and taking trips--even though my source of income was gone. Though, my situation may be different from other people's, but as a background, during those 2 months, I was living in a studio in DC and had a good amount in savings.

I think something to keep in mind is that unemployment is temporary. As long as you haven't given up, your financial situation won't always be like that. For me...

1. Continuing to rent out my studio instead of moving back to parents' place kept my personal growth velocity and motivation up because for me, the environment I'm in matters. 
2. Hanging out with my friends was instrumental in not only staying determined but also cheering up from difficult days. 
3. Going on trips was great for clearing my head. Everyone needs a vacation from work, even if it seems like you're on a 2-month-long one.

All of those involve spending money. However, it's definitely money well-spent if it makes you happy, mentally stable, and therefore more driven to find a job.

### Embrace your unenforced work schedule

At first, I definitely tried to pretend that I was still working a 9 - 5 Monday - Friday job. For around 2 weeks, if it was 10AM on a Tuesday, you bet I was at some Starbucks paying $2.48 for green tea and 8 hours of Wi-Fi, working on side projects. But I found that I was getting more and more negative about being unemployed by doing that. When meeting friends' friends, they might ask me what I do for a living and I'd shamefully reply while avoiding eye contact "oh, err, I'm kind of between things right now." Why be shameful of having time to myself? I realized that I wasn't appreciating the situation I was in. 

During the weeks up until I signed a job offer, I would dedicate at least one day during the work week to exploring DC or just doing things that people don't normally do during work hours.

1. There are so many free Smithsonian attractions that are only open from 9 to 5! And they're usually more empty and quiet during weekdays.
2. Almost no one is ever at the gym from 10 - 12 and 1 - 5. Absolutely free from judgment while failing to lift 35lb weights.
3. Doing laundry is amazing. Almost all machines are available.
4. Buying groceries is more enjoyable. When the store restocks on Tuesday mornings, you can be there to buy the apparently popular tofu. 

Embracing the situation I was in made me less embarrassed about being in it. Just because I was trying to look for a Software Development job, that did not mean I needed to dedicate the standardly allocated 40 hours a week to it.
